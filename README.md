# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a VBA subroutine that would analyse an Excel worksheet containing daily trading information of a list of green energy stocks to extract various measures for each of these stocks based on the dataset. I tested two different code designs that successfully accomplished these tasks and compared their runtimes.
