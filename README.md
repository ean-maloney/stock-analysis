# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a VBA subroutine that would analyse an Excel worksheet containing daily trading information of a list of green energy stocks to extract various measures for each of these stocks based on the dataset. I tested two different code designs that successfully accomplished these tasks and compared their runtimes. 
## Results
Below I have attached the output of my code-generated analysis of a set of green energy stocks from 2017 and 2018.

As these graphics illustrate, 2017 tended to be a good year for the stocks I analyzed, while in 2018 most of these stocks lost value. Additionally, these stocks were highly volatile over this two year period, as is evidenced by the many double- or even triple-digit percentage changes in value over the course of a year. Only two of the stocks I analysed gained value in both years (ENPH and RUN), while only one stock lost value in both 2017 and 2018 (TERP).
